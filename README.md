# Heart Disease Detection using Machine Learning

## Aim

The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning system for the early detection of heart disease by analyzing diverse health attributes such as age, gender, smoking status, blood pressure, glucose levels, heart rate, BMI, and previous medical history.

## Purpose

Heart disease is a major global health concern, often arising from prolonged irregular lifestyles and various bodily dysfunctions. Early detection is crucial for successful treatment and prevention of complications. The purpose of this project is to leverage machine learning algorithms to improve the accuracy of heart disease detection compared to traditional methods. By identifying vulnerability factors and patterns in large datasets, this system aims to provide individuals with insights into their health conditions and facilitate timely medical interventions.

## Scope

The scope of this project encompasses the development of a machine learning system that utilizes different classifier algorithms to accurately identify individuals at risk for heart disease. The system will be trained and tested using a dataset partitioned into training (80%) and testing (20%) datasets. Key features such as age, gender, smoking status, and various health measurements will be utilized to train the algorithms. The system will evaluate the performance of different algorithms and summarize the accuracy achieved by each.

## Proposed System

The proposed system involves the following components:

1. **Data Collection**: Data will be collected from diverse sources and partitioned into training and testing datasets.

2. **Feature Selection**: Relevant features such as age, gender, smoking status, blood pressure, glucose levels, heart rate, BMI, and previous medical history will be selected for analysis.

3. **Classifier Algorithms**: Different classifier algorithms including Random Forest, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and Na√Øve Bayes will be employed to train the system.

4. **Model Evaluation**: The performance of each algorithm will be evaluated using the testing dataset. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score will be calculated to assess the effectiveness of the models.

5. **Summarization**: The results obtained from the evaluation will be summarized to identify the most accurate algorithm for heart disease detection.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Missing values will be handled, and categorical variables will be encoded. The dataset will be split into training and testing datasets.

2. **Feature Engineering**: Relevant features will be selected based on domain knowledge and statistical analysis.

3. **Model Training**: Different classifier algorithms will be trained using the training dataset.

4. **Model Evaluation**: The trained models will be evaluated using the testing dataset, and performance metrics will be calculated.

## Implementation

The project will be implemented using Python programming language and popular libraries such as scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms, pandas for data manipulation, and matplotlib/seaborn for data visualization.

## Results

The results of the evaluation will be summarized to identify the most accurate algorithm for heart disease detection. SVM and KNN algorithms are expected to exhibit similar or superior accuracy compared to other algorithms based on preliminary analysis.
